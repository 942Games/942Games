## Who We Are
We are Joshua and Kyle, a passionate two-person indie game development team based in Aberdeen. Fueled by our love for gaming, we started 942Games to create unique, enjoyable experiences that we personally love to play. Our small size allows us to focus on what truly matters: making games that are fun, engaging, and memorable.

## What We Do
At 942Games, our mission is simple: **create games that we love to play**. Whether itâ€™s an epic adventure or a quirky puzzle game, we pour our creativity and enthusiasm into every project. We're constantly experimenting with new ideas and mechanics, always pushing ourselves to deliver something special.

## Upcoming Projects
- **Crazy Ambulance**: Inspired by the classic Crazy Taxi, this game offers a fresh, exhilarating experience as you navigate the chaos of urban streets.
- **More Coming Soon**: Keep an eye out for more exciting projects on the horizon!
